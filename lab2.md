## Part 3
Something that I learned in week 2 was how to use Github Desktop and the different uses for it. I did not know that GitHub had a feature like this. Because of this, it allows me to work on the lap reports I put on the GitHub from my laptop and desktop at home without having to transfer over files since it is all saved in my GitHub repository. After this class, I can see myself using this a lot.
